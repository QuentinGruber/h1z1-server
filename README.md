## Description

Based on the work of @jseidelin on [soe-network](https://github.com/psemu/soe-network),
h1z1-server is a library that emulates an H1Z1: Just Survive server.

## Motivation

A redditor said : "It's just matter of effort and to have enough people of with interest towards having such private servers to the respected game.
I highly doubt that H1Z1 (Just Survive) is one of those."

So we will see :)

### H1Z1 Dependencies

Like all games H1Z1 has C/C++ & DirectX dependencies.

You may already have them but just in case

- VC 2010 Redist

- VC 2015 Redist

- DirectX Jun 2010 Redist

You can download them all [here](https://mega.nz/file/RtwDWJ7b#QYlxpXz_t0_kp7_S8a7whnWsctJ3Fr5B2sQdnuTR9LQ)

### Setup ClientConfig.ini

On the H1Z1 game folder there is a file name "ClientConfig.ini".

Add `sessionid=0` at the beginning of this file.

And change the _Server_ value to the address of your server , probably `localhost:PORT`

### Launch the game

If you have followed the step just above this one, this step is no longer necessary, and you can start the game by double clicking on H1Z1.exe.

Execute this command in CMD/Powershell ( you have to be in your h1z1 game folder ) :

`.\H1Z1.exe sessionid=0 server=localhost:1115`

### Enable Debug log

Since v0.2.3 of h1z1-server the npm package [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) is used to make debug logs.
