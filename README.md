# h1z1-server [![npm version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/h1z1-server.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/h1z1-server "View this project on npm")

## Versions

This project use Node.js v16.5.0 and the linked npm version to that release.

## Description

Based on the work of @jseidelin on [soe-network](https://github.com/psemu/soe-network),
h1z1-server is a library trying to emulate a h1z1(just survive) server.

## Motivation

A redditor said : "It's just matter of effort and to have enough people of with interest towards having such private servers to the respected game.
I highly doubt that H1Z1 (Just Survive) is one of those."

So we will see :)

## Current Goal

Making this work for the 15 January 2015 version of H1Z1 (first version).

## Setup H1Z1

### Download it

#### The new way (easier)

Make sure you have a version higher than 2.1 of .NET sdk or download the latest version [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).

[Download the latest version of H1DepotDownloader](https://github.com/H1emu/H1DepotDownloader/releases)

#### The old way

Use [DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader) ( only work if you've bought h1z1 )

AppID : 295110 DepotID : 295111 ManifestID : 1930886153446950288

How to use DepotDownloader : https://youtu.be/44HBxzC_RTg

cmd : `dotnet .\DepotDownloader.dll -app 295110 -depot 295111 -manifest 1930886153446950288 -username username -password 1234`

### H1Z1 Dependencies

Like all games H1Z1 has C/C++ & DirectX dependencies.

You may already have them but just in case

- VC 2010 Redist

- VC 2015 Redist

- DirectX Jun 2010 Redist

You can download them all [here](https://mega.nz/file/RtwDWJ7b#QYlxpXz_t0_kp7_S8a7whnWsctJ3Fr5B2sQdnuTR9LQ)

### Setup ClientConfig.ini

**Not needed if you use the H1emu app**

On the H1Z1 game folder there is a file name "ClientConfig.ini".

Add `sessionid=0` at the beginning of this file.

And change the _Server_ value to the adress of your server , probably `localhost:PORT`

### Launch the game

**Not needed if you use the H1emu app**

If you have followed the step just above this one, this step is no longer necessary you can start the game by double clicking on H1Z1.exe.

Execute this command in CMD/Powershell ( you have to be in your h1z1 game folder ) :

`.\H1Z1.exe sessionid=0`

## How to use (3 ways)

### Using the GUI app

The application is at the very beginning of its development, it can contain bugs and is very minimalist.

Download here : https://github.com/H1emu/H1emu-server-app/releases [Easy way]

### Using Quick Start

Clone this repo : [h1z1-server-QuickStart](https://github.com/H1emu/h1z1-server-QuickStart) and follow the instruction in wrote in his README

### Using your own scripts with the library

#### Installation

You need [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) ( currently using 16.0.0 LTS ).

`npm i h1z1-server` to install package

#### LoginServer script exemple

    const H1Z1servers = require("h1z1-server");
    var server = new H1Z1servers.LoginServer(
    1115, // <- server port
    "" // <- MongoDB address ( if blank server start in solo mode )
    );
    server.start();

### Enable Debug log

Since v0.2.3 of h1z1-server the npm package [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) is used to make debug logs.

Windows command prompt notes
CMD
On Windows the environment variable is set using the set command.

    set DEBUG=*,-not_this

Example:

    set DEBUG=* & node app.js

PowerShell (VS Code default)
PowerShell uses different syntax to set environment variables.

    $env:DEBUG = "*,-not_this"

Example:

    $env:DEBUG='app';node app.js

Then, run the program to be debugged as usual.

npm script example:

    "windowsDebug": "@powershell -Command $env:DEBUG='*';node app.js",

#### My debug scripts

From my package.json, if it can help.

    "scripts": {
        "login-server": "set DEBUG=* & node loginserver.js",
        "login-client": "set DEBUG=* & node loginclient.js",
        "gateway-server": "set DEBUG=* & node GatewayServer.js",
        "zone-server": "set DEBUG=* & node ZoneServer.js",
        "zone-client": "set DEBUG=* & node ZoneClient.js"
    }
